This is the server backend for [showterm](https://github.com/ConradIrwin/showterm).

It's hopefully available on the internet at
[http://showterm.io](https://showterm.herokuapp.com), but it might still only be at
(https://showterm.herokuapp.com)[https://showterm.herokuapp.com] because I was too slow
in getting the DNS set up.

As usual bug-reports and pull-requests are very welcome. Everything is licensed under the
MIT license.

TODO
====

* Allow people to run their own private showterm.io sites
* Add a static mode (currently 'race' solves the problem, but it's a bit lame).
* See also TODO on the [showterm](https://github.com/ConradIrwin/showterm) gem.
